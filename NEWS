telepathy-stream-engine 0.5.1 (2008-04-11)
==========================================

* Add support for holding calls, so Farsight frees the resources used by
  the call.
* Refactor stream class into separate audio and video subclasses.
* Add support for dumping a dotty graph of the pipeline on SIGUSR1.
* Add --enable-coverage to build with coverage support.
* Raise telepathy-glib dependency to 0.7.6 for hold support.
* Raise Farsight dependency to 0.1.27 for working hold.

telepathy-stream-engine 0.5.0 (2008-04-04)
==========================================

* Refactoring to take us closer to having a "stream engine" library,
  cleaning up API of channel/session/stream to allow inheritance.
* Port to use telepathy-glib instead of libtelepathy, increasing
  robustness at shutdown and against CM crashes.
* Use gconf and auto audio source/sink elements if available.
* Add elements to allow volume control and muting when on non-maemo DSP
  platforms.
* Remove fakesink element in video pipeline so the video device will be
  closed when there are no preview windows or video streams.
* Fix race conditions where multiple stream objects could be created for
  the same CM streams.
* Installs to ${libexecdir} now, instead of ${bindir}.
* Raise Farsight dependency to 0.1.26 for predictable source/sink
  element reference counting behaviour.
